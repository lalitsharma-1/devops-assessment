a. How do you make the service scalable?
   ---Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Scale pods based on CPU/Memory usage
   ---Cluster Autoscaler: Use AWS Auto Scaling Groups to add/remove nodes based on demand.

b. What CI/CD pipeline would you use (if not done in code, please describe every
   step from the commit of new code until the new code is running in production)?
   ---Developer Commit -> Build -> Test -> Staging Deployment ->Approval -> Production Deployment

c. How would you store and deploy secrets (such as API keys)?
   --- Use Kubernetes Secrets & Reference the secret in your Deployment YAML

d. How do you test how well your infrastructure scales (when many requests come
   in)?
   --- Use k6 or Apache JMeter for load testing

e. How do you provide an SSL certificate for your service?
   --- Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL certificate
   ---Attach the certificate ARN to the Kubernetes Service annotations
